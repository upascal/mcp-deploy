# Clean up ui

I dont like the placement of the "clear" buttons maybe they should be where the "text buttons" are? 
or maybe it should just auto "clear" after deleting the feild input entirely? 

also testing could "auto-test" after the api key is added. 

the "test" button on the zotero api should be for both the library and the api key, therefore it should be after or it should "auto test" after the api key is added/updated


## Change color scheme

Change the color scheme to be more "academic" and less "techy". right now it has the same color scheme as porn hub which is not what i want. 

## secret toggle glitches 

the secret toggle glitches and chnages the color of the background to white under some cirumstances. respect the light/dark mode setting and dont make fields the wrong color
